     * \brief AX.25 decoder that supports the legacy hardware radios.
     *
     * This block takes as input a quadrature demodulated bit stream.
     * Each byte should contains only one bit of information at the LSB.
     *
     * The block will try to find an AX.25 frame. If the frame pass the
     * CRC check then a blob PMT message is produced at the message output
     * indicated with name 'out'. Otherwise if the frame did not pass the
     * CRC check or the size was invalid, a blob PMT message is generated at
     * the output port with the name 'fail'. This will help to recover at least
     * some bytes from a corrupted message.
     *
     * The block also supports destination callsign check. Only frames with
     * the right destination Callsign will be accepted. This feature can be
     * disabled using the promisc parameter.
