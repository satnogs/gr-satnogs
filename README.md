# gr-satnogs: SatNOGS GNU Radio Out-Of-Tree Module
gr-satnogs is an out-of-tree GNU Radio module that provides all the necessary tools
for decoding signals from various scientific and academic sattelites.

## Install

### Requirements
* GNU Radio ( > 3.7.7 )
* CMake ( > 3.1)
* G++ (with C++11 support)
* VOLK
* libogg 
* libvorbis
* git

**Optional**
* gr-osmocom (for using the flowgraphs with real SDR hardware)
* libnova (for building the debug blocks)

### Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/satnogs/gr-satnogs.git`
2. `cd gr-satnogs`
3. `mkdir build`
4. `cmake ..`
5. `make`
6. `sudo make install`

If this is the first time you are building the gr-satnogs module run
`sudo ldconfig`

#### Advanced
By default, the **SatNOGS** module will use the default installation prefix.
This highly depends on the Linux distribution. You can use the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`
variable to alter the default installation path.
E.g: 

`cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..`

Also, by default the build system enables a set of blocks used for debugging
during the development. The enable/disable switch is controled through the 
`INCLUDE_DEBUG_BLOCKS` boolean variable. If for example, you want to disable the
debugging blocks, the **CMake** command would be:

`cmake -DINCLUDE_DEBUG_BLOCKS=OFF ..`

Another common control option is the library sugffix of the Linux distribution.
There are distributions like Fedora, openSUSE, e.t.c that the their 64-bit version
use the `lib64` folder to store the 64-bit versions of their dynamic libraries.
On the other hand, distributions like Ubuntu do the exact opposite. They use
`lib` directory for the libraries of the native architecture and place the 32-bit versions
on the `lib32` directory. In any case the correct library directory suffix
can be specified with the `LIB_SUFFIX` variable. For example:

`cmake -DLIB_SUFFIX=64 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DINCLUDE_DEBUG_BLOCKS=OFF ..`

will install the libraries at the `/usr/lib64` directory.
